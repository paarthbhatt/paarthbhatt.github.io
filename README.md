# my-v0-project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies. This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager.

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `pnpm start`

Starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with `pnpm build` first.

### `pnpm lint`

Runs the linter to catch errors in the code.
